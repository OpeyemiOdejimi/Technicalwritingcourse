## Introduction

ASCIIDOC is a lightweight markup language used for creating documents, such as books, manuals, and articles. AsciiDoc  is about being able to  focus on expressing your ideas, writing freely and passing on information without the distraction of complex applications or angle bracket. 
It also allows you to focus on your writing but worry just on tweaking the output when you are ready to convert the document.  The plain-text of an [Asciidoc](https://asciidoc.org) document is easily converted into a variety of input formats, beautifully formatted, without having to having to rewrite the content. 

### Key Features:
